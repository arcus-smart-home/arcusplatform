           CREATED - Transient state meaning the device has been created but the driver is not running.  Clients should not see this state generally.
           PROVISIONING - The driver is still in the process of configuring the device for initial use.
           ACTIVE - The driver is fully loaded.  Note there may be additional error preventing it from running 'normally', see devadv:errors.
           UNSUPPORTED - The device is using the fallback driver, it is not really supported by the platform.  This is often due to pairing errors, in which case devadv:errors will be populated.
           RECOVERABLE - The device has been deleted from the hub, but may be recovered by re-pairing it with the hub.
           UNRECOVERABLE - The device has been deleted from the hub and it is not possible to re-pair it.
           TOMBSTONED - The user has force removed the device but it still exists in the hub database.
